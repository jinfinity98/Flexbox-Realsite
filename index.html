            <header> Wassup, my name is Jeffery or Jeff for short! </header>
            <main> I am a aspiring web developer student at the moment. I am taking classes on skilllcrush and I hope that I can hone my
                   skills into becoming a freelance web developer by the end of this year. Coding is challenging, but I think I'm getting
                   the hang of it!! </main>
            <div class="div-1">
                <p>I was born and raised in Albany, Georgia, a small city that is about 3 hours away from the well known city of Atlanta.
                   There isn't much to do in this small city, but the cost of living isn't that high so I guess that's one good thing about it.
                   I do hope to move away from this city one day though. I hope I can move to a city that's bigger but also not too expensive or busy, <span>something in the middle.</span></p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p><span>My passion:</span> I have a real passion for music, anime and pretty much anything that is expressing the arts.
                         I enjoy writing and I have written a couple of songs that I haven't released yet, but I plan to release them some day.
                         I am starting to develop a love for coding the more that I do it. It makes me feel supersmart when I am able to code
                         something successfully or troubleshoot coding successfully.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p><span>Favorite Animes:</span> I didn't talk about anime in that last paragraph, but some of my favorites are
                         Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood, Parasyte The Maxim, Assassination Classroom, and Yuu Yuu Hakusho.
                         If you want to get into anime these are some good series to start with! Anime is the ultimate artform besides music!!</p>
